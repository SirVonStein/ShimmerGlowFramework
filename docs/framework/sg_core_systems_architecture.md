## Overview

The ShimmerGlow Core Systems Architecture establishes the technical foundation for consciousness transformation technology, integrating four primary systems: Universal Event Tracking, Emotional Intelligence (FRSM), AI Companion Partnership, and Community Formation. This architecture prioritizes user sovereignty, privacy protection, and authentic transformation over engagement optimization and data extraction. Rooted in FRSM/AQI principles, the system design treats technology as sacred vessel for human flourishing rather than addiction mechanism.
